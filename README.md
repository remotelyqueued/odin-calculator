# odin-calculator

I guess the goal here is to get the calculator to operate gracefully

not all user errors produce NaN or reset the calculation

tried to catch most basic errors I could

I started out trying to use arrays but ran into issues having to parse things in multiple places so I restarted the project a few times

went a bit out of scope but I think created something I am somewhat proud of

todo:

✔️ add
✔️ subtract
✔️ multiply
✔️ divide
✔️ operate function
✔️ display function
✔️ evaluate single pair at a time
✔️ not allow pressing equal before entering all numbers  
✔️ clear wipes data
✔️ handle division by 0
✔️ floating point numbers
✔️ backspace
✔️ round long answers

-   formatted output (commas)
-   string together several operations
-   ui css
-   keyboard support
-   sound
