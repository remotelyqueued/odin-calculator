# odin-calculator

I guess the goal here is to get the calculator to operate gracefully

not all user errors produce NaN or reset the calculation

tried to catch most basic errors I could

I started out trying to use arrays but ran into issues having to parse things in multiple places so I restarted the project a few times

went a bit out of scope but I think created something I am somewhat proud of

todo:
- look for unused code (reduce logic)
- rename variables
- keydown
- integrate operate into code a bit better
- play sounds on click
- handle floating point math better
- remove history display
