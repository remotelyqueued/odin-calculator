# odin-calculator

I guess the goal for me here was to get the calculator to operate gracefully

not all user errors produce unusable results or reset the calculation

support for:

✔️ add  
✔️ subtract  
✔️ multiply  
✔️ divide  
✔️ operate function  
✔️ display function  
✔️ evaluate single pair at a time  
✔️ not allow pressing equal before entering all numbers  
✔️ clear wipes data  
✔️ handle division by 0  
✔️ floating point numbers  
✔️ backspace  
✔️ round long answers  
✔️ string together several operations  
✔️ keyboard support  
✔️ sound  
✔️ text overflow (break)  
✔️ formatted text (commas)  
✔️ text overflow (scroll)  
✔️ ui design  
✔️ simulate key down on keypress (active)  

todo:

-   try out webpack
-   issue with audio key2
-   different pop culture reference
